<b>*Business transformation and automation*</b> are important for companies to stay competitive in today's rapidly changing business environment. Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks that were previously done by humans, while business transformation involves rethinking and restructuring a company's business processes to become more efficient, effective, and adaptable.

There are several reasons why businesses need to embrace transformation and automation. For one, it allows companies to _reduce costs by streamlining their operations, increasing productivity, and eliminating redundancies_. This can lead to <b>improved profitability and competitiveness</b>.
