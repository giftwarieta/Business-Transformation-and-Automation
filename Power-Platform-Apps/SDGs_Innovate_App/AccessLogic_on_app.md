# Access Logic on App
1. On first login, the user is prompted to update his/her profile with Gender, Date of Birth and password. This stage is critical in the application functionality as it determines the screens a user can access and certain privileges the user have. By default, the user is given a **"User"** right.

2. On subsequent login, if the user has been registered as a user in the AppUsers dataverse table, only password would be requested.
