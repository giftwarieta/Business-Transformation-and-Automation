# SDGs Innovate App

This is an application developed with the aim of promoting Gender Equality (the Sustainable Development Goal 5). The target of this goal is to achieve achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.


## Business Case
SDG 5 aims to achieve gender equality by ending all forms of discrimination, violence and any harmful practices against women and girls in the public and private spheres. It also calls for the full participation of women and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of political and economic decision-making.

Women especially in the developing countries of the world are not priviledged to be empowered like the males especially in the areas of financial and skill empowerment.

My goal with the SDGs Innovate App, is to create a platform where the female users would be able to learn skills which will eventually empower them financially and for career growth.

## My Approach:
Using the Agile methodology, I implemented the solution by leveraging on ##Powerapp canvas app, Power Virtual Agent, Dataverse and Power Automate

## UI/UX
The app is built with simplicity and user's ease of interractivity in mind especially when accessing the app on their mobile phone.

The choice of color is deliberate as it symbolizes gender equality. According to the International women's day website, the use of these three colors is very significant: purple, green and white.

While using the application, users have the options to toggle between the theme (default or modified theme) of their choice from the Setting section of the app as shown below.

## Dataverse table creation
Below are the tables created

* AppUsers: this table holds the information of login users who have now been authorized to use the app. This table plays a key role in identifying the user's gender and admin role determining privileges to viewable screens.
Below are the required columns
  1. AppUser - this holds the ID
  2. Email
  3. First Name
  4. Last Name
  5. Full Name
  6. Gender
  7. Role

* Job Vacancy: this table holds the information about availabe job vacancies.
Below are the required columns

## Benefits of this automation
By automating this process, I was able to streamline the administrative tasks associated with issuing training certificates and ensure that every participant receives their certificate promptly. This also helps to enhance the overall experience for participants and reinforce the value of your company's courses. Additionally, the automated system will free up your staff's time, enabling them to focus on developing and delivering high-quality courses to your growing base of participants.
